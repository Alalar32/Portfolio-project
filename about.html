     <p>
    My name is <strong>Elijah Tawiah Dotse</strong>, and I am a passionate learner with a deep interest 
    in technology, problem-solving, and creativity. I am currently pursuing my studies in computer science–related 
    fields, where I am developing strong skills in programming (C++, Python), web development, cybersecurity, 
    and digital logic design. Alongside academics, I enjoy challenging myself with projects that allow me 
    to turn ideas into reality and push me to grow as both a developer and a thinker.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond technology, I am a committed musician and dedicated trumpeter, serving in my church every week. 
    This blend of music and technology shapes who I am: disciplined, creative, and focused on excellence. 
    Whether it is building a project that can stand out in competition or playing music that inspires others, 
    I strive to use my gifts to make a positive impact.
  </p>
  <p>
    My ultimate goal is to combine my technical knowledge, creativity, and dedication to continuous learning 
    in order to contribute meaningfully to the world of technology, while also remaining true to my values 
    and service in my community.
